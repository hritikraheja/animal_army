Ownerless, we cannot fathom what moved someone to bind this poor gentle boy in the first place, only to then turn him loose to find his food on roadside plants and grasses. He grew, but the rope, of course, did not. When we found him, he was starting to fade away. Pain had dulled his appetite and he'd grown weary of fighting it. But within hours we had the maggots out of the wound, flushed away all the dirt and blood, and soothed him with a snug bandage that we would change daily for 7 weeks.
